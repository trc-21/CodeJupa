     <h1>Hello, World. Welcome to my website!</h1>
     <p>This is my first web page. My introduction to the world of coding.</p>

     <p>My name is Tavares Chestnut. Electrician by trade. Coding because it's fun. Some people call me a fool. Why learn how to code? Isn't it easier to be a tradesman in the electrical field? Blue collar jobs will never go away. Everyone needs a sparky?, right?</p>
